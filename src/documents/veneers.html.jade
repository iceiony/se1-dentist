            p.
                Veneers are very thin shells of porcelain which are made to fit over the
                visible surface of your tooth. Providing the ideal way of treating discoloured
                severely discoloured, chipped, cracked or unsightly teeth, Veneers are
                recognized for being a long lasting and natural looking way of dramatically
                improving the appearance of your smile.

            h2 What are the advantages of veneers?
            p.
                Veneers make teeth look natural and healthy. As they are very thin
                and are held in place by a special strong bond (rather like
                super-glue) very little preparation of the tooth is needed.

            h2 How long do dental veneers last?
            p.
                Porcelain veneers will typically last between five and ten years, meaning
                that they will need to eventually be replaced. To make your veneers last
                longer, follow a good oral hygiene program and visit your dentist for
                check-ups on a regular basis.
