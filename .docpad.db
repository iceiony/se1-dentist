A gap\n                  can also mean your bite is affected, because the teeth next to the space\n                  can lean into the gap and alter the way the upper and lower teeth bite\n                  together.

However,\n                these immediate dentures will need modifying, re-lining or replacing\n                within the first 6 months due to the changes that will take place in your\n                gums after extraction.

You can either brush them with a denture brush\n                and toothpaste or a soft nail brush and soap. It is also recommended to\n                soak them regularly in a special cleaning solution.<br/>Even with full dentures, you still need to take good care of your mouth.\n                Every morning and evening, brush your gums, tongue and the roof of your\n                mouth with a soft-bristled brush. This removes plaque and helps the circulation\n                in your mouth. If you wear partial dentures, it is even more important\n                that you brush your teeth thoroughly every day. This will help stop tooth\n                decay and gum disease that can lead to you losing more of your teeth.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_willMyDenturesStay.jpg\" alt=\"Will my dentures stay in position?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>Will my dentures stay in position?</h2>\n              <p>\n                Well-designed dentures should stay firmly in place and fit your gums\n                comfortably. However, due to the changes in your mouth, dentures may\n                over time become loose or start slipping. If this happens you should\n                consult your dentist. A fixative cream can be used to hold the dentures in\n                place but not for an extended period of time.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_shouldIWhare.jpg\" alt=\"Should I wear my dentures to bed?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>Should I wear my dentures to bed?</h2>\n              <p>\n                It is recommended not to wear your dentures when sleeping. Taking out\n                the dentures will allow your mouth and gums to rest. Make sure to keep\n                your dentures in a moist environment whilst out of the mouth to stop\n                them from drying out.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_whenShouldIreplace.jpg\" alt=\"When should I replace my dentures?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>When should I replace my dentures?</h2>\n              <p>\n                You will probably need to renew your dentures every five years to reflect\n                changes in the mouth throughout life.

However,\n                these immediate dentures will need modifying, re-lining or replacing\n                within the first 6 months due to the changes that will take place in your\n                gums after extraction.

You can either brush them with a denture brush\n                and toothpaste or a soft nail brush and soap. It is also recommended to\n                soak them regularly in a special cleaning solution.<br/>Even with full dentures, you still need to take good care of your mouth.\n                Every morning and evening, brush your gums, tongue and the roof of your\n                mouth with a soft-bristled brush. This removes plaque and helps the circulation\n                in your mouth. If you wear partial dentures, it is even more important\n                that you brush your teeth thoroughly every day. This will help stop tooth\n                decay and gum disease that can lead to you losing more of your teeth.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_willMyDenturesStay.jpg\" alt=\"Will my dentures stay in position?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>Will my dentures stay in position?</h2>\n              <p>\n                Well-designed dentures should stay firmly in place and fit your gums\n                comfortably. However, due to the changes in your mouth, dentures may\n                over time become loose or start slipping. If this happens you should\n                consult your dentist. A fixative cream can be used to hold the dentures in\n                place but not for an extended period of time.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_shouldIWhare.jpg\" alt=\"Should I wear my dentures to bed?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>Should I wear my dentures to bed?</h2>\n              <p>\n                It is recommended not to wear your dentures when sleeping. Taking out\n                the dentures will allow your mouth and gums to rest. Make sure to keep\n                your dentures in a moist environment whilst out of the mouth to stop\n                them from drying out.\n              </p>\n              <!--<br />-->\n              <!--<p><img src=\"images/header_dentures_whenShouldIreplace.jpg\" alt=\"When should I replace my dentures?\" /><br />-->\n              <h2>When should I replace my dentures?</h2>\n              <p>\n                You will probably need to renew your dentures every five years to reflect\n                changes in the mouth throughout life.

The life expectancy of a white filling can depend greatly on\n                where it is in your mouth and how heavily your teeth come together\n                when you bite. Your dentist can advise you on the life expectancy of your\n                fillings.\n              </p>\n              <!--<p><br />-->\n              <!--<img src=\"images/header_whiteFilling_WorthIt.jpg\" alt=\"Can I replace my amalgam fillings with white ones?
